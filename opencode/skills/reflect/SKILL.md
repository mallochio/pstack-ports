# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "the `reflect` skill". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

Before fanning out, find this conversation's transcript in the the harness's session store directory the system prompt names. Do not glob across `the harness's other workspaces' session stores`. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects.

```bash
list recent session files in this session's transcript directory (see the harness notes for the store path)
```

That covers the legacy flat (`<id>.jsonl`), current nested (`<id>/<id>.jsonl`), and subagent (`<parent>/subagents/<child>.jsonl`) layouts. For each candidate, read the first JSONL line. Take the file whose `message.content[0].text` contains the conversation's opening user prompt. If none matches, pass a tight digest of the session instead.

## 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three `task` calls, the `general` subagent, full tool access. Reviewers need MCP access to look up the tickets, chat threads, and observability traces the transcript references, and denied tools strip MCPs.

Each reviewer and the synthesizer name a role line in the `pstack-models.md` rule and a default. Set `model` to that line's value, or to the default if the rule or the line is missing. Leave `model` unset when the value is `auto` or `inherit-parent`. If the `task` tool rejects a role value, omit `model` so that seat runs on the parent model and say so. If it rejects that, omit `model` so it runs on the parent model and say so. Pick each subagent's reasoning level for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.

| Lens | Role line | Default `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `inherit-parent` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `inherit-parent` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `inherit-parent` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the `task` response body.

## 3. Synthesize

One `task` call, the `general` subagent, `model` from the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` line (default `inherit-parent`), full tool access. It spot-verifies citations through MCP, and denied tools strip MCPs. Pass `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. It returns an Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File each Backlog item to your team's devex or backlog tracker without waiting. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does it directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the `authoring-a-skill` playbook and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to the `authoring-a-skill` playbook and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via authoring-a-skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to the `authoring-a-skill` playbook. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
